## Project Overview
The **Web-Based MCQ Quiz System** bridges the gap between traditional learning and interactive assessments. It allows users to:
- Log in securely
- Select a programming language and topic
- Attempt dynamically generated quizzes
- Receive instant scoring and feedback
- Store scores for future reference

---

## Features
-  **Secure Authentication** – User registration and login system
-  **Three Languages Supported** – C, Java, Python
-  **Topic-Wise Question Bank** – Each language has 3 topics, 10 questions each
-  **Real-Time Validation** – Immediate feedback on answers
-  **Score Storage** – Results saved for later review
-  **Responsive Design** – Works across devices

---

## Technologies Used
**Frontend**
- HTML – Page structure
- CSS – Styling and layout
- JavaScript – Quiz interactivity

**Backend**
- PHP – Server-side scripting
- MySQL – Database management

---

## Database Design
- **Users Table** – Stores user credentials (username, email, password)
- **Questions Table** – Stores quiz questions and options
- **Answers Table** – Stores correct answers
- **Scores Table** – Stores user scores after quiz completion

---

## System Workflow
1. **Login Page** – User authentication (sign up / log in)
2. **Welcome Page** – Language and topic selection
3. **Quiz Page** – Dynamic question presentation
4. **Answer Processing (`next.php`)** – Compares user answers with database
5. **Result Page (`result.php`)** – Displays final score (out of 10)
